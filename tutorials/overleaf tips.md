### Overleaf Keyboard Shortcuts

Keys | Effect
--- | ---
`ctrl` + `s` | Recompiles the project aka you're view of the output file on the right.
`alt` + drag `left mouse button` | Highlights parts of code according to the box you make instead of by line. </br></br> This may be very useful if you want to edit multiple spots e.g. on a table. 


### Compiling types

| Typically, Overleaf defaults to `fast compile` meaning that when you make edits, it'll often only recompile the parts that you've edited. I personally like having `normal` turned on since it guarentees that I'll catch propogating errors. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![alt text](image-8.png?raw=true) |
