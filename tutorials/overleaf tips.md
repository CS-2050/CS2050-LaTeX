### Overleaf Keyboard Shortcuts
A lot of these shortcuts aren't specific to Overleaf and very handy for other programming too.

Keys | Effect
--- | ---
`ctrl` + `s`                        | Recompiles the project aka you're view of the output file on the right.
`shift` + `tab`                     | Unindents selected lines (i.e., it's basically a `reverse-tab`)
`alt` + `up arrow` $\uparrow$ </br> `alt` + `down arrow` $\downarrow$ | Shifts all selected text up/down a line (exchanges it with the line above/below)
`alt` + drag `left mouse button`    | Highlights parts of code according to the box you make instead of by line. </br></br> This may be very useful if you want to edit multiple spots e.g. on a table. 
`ctrl` + `left mouse button`        | Allows you to click multiple spots while keeping cursors in them all.</br></br> This may be useful if you're trying to for instance add a $T$ in multiple spots of a truth table.
`ctrl` + `u`                        | Turns all selected text to uppercase
`ctrl` + `shift` + `u`              | Turns all selected text to lowercase
`ctrl` + `space`                    | Opens the **autocomplete** menu

### Compiling types

| Typically, Overleaf defaults to `fast compile` meaning that when you make edits, it'll often only recompile the parts that you've edited. </br> </br>This has caused some people issues in the past and so I personally like having `normal` turned on since it guarentees that I'll catch propogating errors. </br></br>Again as well, `ctrl` + `s` tells Overleaf to immediately recomplile again -- based off of this setting. </br></br></br></br></br></br>| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![alt text](../attachments/image-8.png?raw=true) |
