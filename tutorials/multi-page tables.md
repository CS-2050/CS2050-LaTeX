# Multi-Page Tables
If you want a table to spill onto a new line vertically while maintaining the previous appearance (e.g. column widths, center, etc.), you can use the package `longtable`.


At the top with the rest of the packages, make sure to have longtable imported.
```latex
\usepackage{longtable}
```

Besides that, the useage is extremly similar to `tabular`

<table border="0">
 <tr>
    <td><b style="font-size:25px">Tabular</b></td>
    <td><b style="font-size:25px">Longtable</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Lorem ipsum ...</td>
    <td>Lorem ipsum ...</td>
 </tr>
</table>
