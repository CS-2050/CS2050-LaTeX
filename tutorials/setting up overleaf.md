# Setting up Overleaf for the first time
Welcome to the world of `LaTeX`! Here you'll find a short step-by-step to creating your first documents and/or making use of our templates.

Overleaf, for those that don't know, is essentially an online editor and compiler for `LaTeX` that allows you to store, access, and share like you would a `Google Doc` ! It even allows live-editing by multiple users at the same time.

You can either make your own account or login using your @gatech.edu email. If you use your Georgia Tech login, there are a few templates that you'll have access to from the getgo which may be useful until you get a stronger grasp. You can also link your two accounts so you have access to all the Gatech files.





Setup            |  Visual
:-------------------------|:-------------------------
Go to [overleaf.com](overleaf.com) and click "login" at the top right. | ![alt text](image.png?raw=true) 
Click at the bottom where it says "Log In with SSO" and follow the instructions using your GT Login. </br></br>You can link your personal email too later or create an account using that. | ![alt text](image-1.png?raw=true)
Now, when you go to overleaf.com, it should take you to the 'projects' page at [overleaf.com/project](overleaf.com/project). </br></br> Here you tinker around and add tags, shared files, etc. | ![alt text](image-2.png?raw=true) 
Click 'new project' to get started. You'll see plenty of template options including the $\color{gold} \textnormal{Georgia Tech}$ template. </br></br> For now though, click the 'Blank Project' option and name it. | ![alt text](image-3.png?raw=true)
You can treat this project as a folder that contains all your documents. I personally create one of these for a class and call it a day, using folders to sort it if needed. | ![alt text](image-4.png?raw=true)
To upload our template, you can click upload button at the top left and drag-and-drop the `.tex` file in. This is also how you add `images`. | ![alt text](image-5.png?raw=true)
You also have the option of importing files from other projects and uploading entire folders of files (e.g. if you have a folder of images you want to use). | ![alt text](image-6.png?raw=true)
And there you go. Press compile or `ctrl` + `s` to compile the template for the first time. More info and tips can be found on other pages in this wiki. | ![alt text](image-7.png?raw=true)

## Overleaf Keyboard Shortcuts

Keys | Effect
--- | ---
`ctrl` + `s` | Recompiles the project aka you're view of the output file on the right.
`alt` + drag `left mouse button` | Highlights parts of code according to the box you make instead of by line. </br></br> This may be very useful if you want to edit multiple spots e.g. on a table.
